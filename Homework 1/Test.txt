A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is the standard method for interacting with and managing files and folders. It provides a visual representation of your systemâ€™s organization, using icons and images to depict folders and documents. Folders serve as containers for files, allowing you to efficiently organize and navigate your interface by visually identifying where items are located.
 Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface used to interact with a computer system or software by typing commands. Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that rely on visual elements like icons and buttons, a CLI requires users to input specific text commands to perform tasks such as navigating directories, running programs, and managing files.
